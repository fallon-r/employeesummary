For this project, I am building an app that will spit out an HTML page based on a few short inquirer prompts. Additionally, the code needs to pass a few tests. 

While have been able to construct the prompts and access the output dir, i have been unable to get the code functioning as intended. The node server does not run live and I am currently unable to access/add in a webgui.
